## Components

### Tracers
Different types of tracers for various aspects of agent behavior:
- Agentic Tracing: Main tracing functionality
- Base: Core tracing functionality
- Agent Tracer: Tracks agent behavior and decision-making
- LLM Tracer: Monitors language model interactions
- Network Tracer: Tracks network activities
- Tool Tracer: Monitors tool usage
- User Interaction Tracer: Tracks user interactions

### Data
Core data structures and classes:
- Data Structure: Common data structures used across tracers
- Data Classes: Data class definitions for the tracing system

### Utils
Helper functions and utilities to support tracing functionality:
- File Name Tracker: Tracks file names and paths
- Unique Decorator: Provides unique identification functionality
- Zip List of Unique Files: Handles file operations

### Upload
Components for uploading and managing trace data
